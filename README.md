Then run it:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
If you want to run it with Flask environment variables:

bash
Copy code
export FLASK_APP=app.py         # For Windows: set FLASK_APP=app.py
export FLASK_ENV=development    # Optional (enables debug mode)
flask run
STEP 5: Access the Web App
Open your browser and go to:

cpp
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000/
You should see your facial emotion detection web interface!

STEP 6: Test the Emotion Detection
Use your webcam or image upload feature (depending on how your project is set up) to capture a face and detect emotion.
